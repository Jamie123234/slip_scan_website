        <p>Tax season is stressful, but it's even worse when you realize you've left money on the table. Here are 10 commonly overlooked deductions you should be tracking.</p>

        <h3>1. Home Office Expenses</h3>
        <p>If you work from home, you can claim a portion of your utilities, internet, and even rent/mortgage interest based on the square footage of your office space.</p>

        <h3>2. Software Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>Don't forget the monthly fees for apps like Slip-Scan, Xero, Slack, or Adobe Creative Cloud. These are 100% deductible business expenses.</p>

        <h3>3. Bank Fees</h3>
        <p>Monthly service charges, overdraft fees, and wire transfer fees on your business account add up over a year.</p>

        <h3>4. Vehicle Expenses</h3>
        <p>Beyond just gas, don't forget car washes, parking fees, tolls, and servicing costs if the vehicle is used for business.</p>

        <h3>5. Professional Development</h3>
        <p>Courses, books, seminars, and workshops related to your industry are deductible. Investing in yourself saves you tax.</p>

        <h3>6. Startup Costs</h3>
        <p>Did you buy a domain name or pay for incorporation before you officially launched? You can often amortize these startup costs.</p>

        <h3>7. Business Meals</h3>
        <p>Meeting a client for lunch? Generally, 50% of the cost is deductible. Make sure to note who you met with on the receipt.</p>

        <h3>8. Office Supplies</h3>
        <p>Small items like printer paper, pens, and staples are often paid for with cash and the receipts get lost. Scan them immediately!</p>

        <h3>9. Phone Bill</h3>
        <p>If you use your personal phone for business, a percentage of that bill is a valid business expense.</p>

        <h3>10. Bad Debt</h3>
        <p>If a client never paid you and you've already recorded the income, you can write off that uncollectible amount.</p>
